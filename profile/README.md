## 🐴 About us
_The Cometbid Software Foundation (CSF for short)_ is a non-profit public organization to provide a platform for open, collaborative Software development projects by supplying Cloud infrastructure, management, monitoring, communication, and Business infrastructure for Startups, Green-field projects and Corporations.

## Background and History
1. _The Cometbid Software Foundation_ is heavily linked to the cometbid-project idea on github with the author's several years of labouring in isolation on projects.
2. CSF started with a group of tech experts especially of African descent who over the years have had challenges working in Silos and wishes to see collaboration become a central ingredient for success.
   
More later ...  


### 🏹 Aims and Objectives

1. To build a community of tech experts that share ideas and  build projects collectively.
2. To build groups/teams from the community that discuss tech topics of interest.
3. To serve as avenue for Businesses and External entities to solicit usage of our code components with paid support in the long-term - while they can also contribute code to the community's projects.
4. In this community, all codes will be free for both Personal and Commercial usage with conditions of use, and paid-support agreements under the OSS(Open Software Standard) standards.
5. We will work to ensure high quality of our Design, maintain high-level coding standards, adherence to local and international laws on data usage and distribution, code quality, testability, reusability, maintenance, and documentation.
6. Members and Contributors will sign an MOU(Memorandum of Understanding), and Copyright agreement on usage of their work as all contributions is voluntary(unpaid).
7. To provide legal protection to volunteers working on CSF projects, and to prevent the 'Cometbid' brand name from being used by other orgaizations with permission.
8. To provide expert advice to African startups via Tech events, shows, trainings and Conferences mostly on how to:
   i.   Structure software devleopment team to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.  
   ii.  Manage development team(s) and mitigate the risk of losing coding staffs in an ongoing project.  
        Avoid the danger of poor planning, lack of upfront design and  Architecture, and absence of CI/CD pipelines and coding standards. More importantly, to incorporate tests in the Deployment pipeline.  
   iii. Take advantage of Cloud services, and ensure coding standards and best practices.  
   iv. Provision Cloud infrastructure, monitor usage and manage cost.  
   v. Automate deploymemt to the Cloud with seamless integration testing.

In general terms, we will work to ensure African tech startups and corporations build properly in order to scale globally, and those will include members of this community.
This community is meant to trascend several generations and legacy must remain after we are long gone.
