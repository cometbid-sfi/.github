## 🐴 About us
_The Cometbid Software Foundation (CSF for short)_ is a non-profit public organization to provide a platform for open, collaborative Software development projects by supplying Cloud infrastructure, management, monitoring, communication, and Business infrastructure for Startups, Green-field projects and Corporations.

## 🏫 Background and History
1. _The Cometbid Software Foundation_ is heavily linked to the cometbid-project idea on github with the author's several years of labouring in isolation on projects.
2. CSF started with a group of tech experts especially of African descent who over the years have had challenges working in Silos and wishes to see collaboration become a central ingredient for success.   
More later ...  


### 🏹 Aims and Objectives

1. To build a community of tech experts that share ideas and  build projects collectively.
2. To build groups/teams from the community that discuss tech topics of interest.
3. To serve as avenue for Businesses and External entities to solicit usage of our code components with paid support in the long-term - while they can also contribute code to the community's projects.
4. In this community, all codes will be free to the public for both Personal and Commercial usage with conditions of use with paid-support agreements under the OSS(Open-Source Software) standards.
5. We will work to ensure high quality of our Design, maintain high-level coding standards, adhere to local and international laws on data usage and distribution, code quality, testability, reusability, maintenance, and documentation.
6. Members and Contributors will sign an MOU(Memorandum of Understanding), and Copyright agreement on usage of their work as all contributions is voluntary(unpaid).
7. To provide legal protection to volunteers working on CSF projects, and to prevent the 'Cometbid' brand name from being used by other orgaizations without permission.
8. To provide expert advice to African startups via Tech events, shows, trainings and Conferences mostly on how to:  
   **i.**   Structure software devleopment team to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.  
   **ii.**  Manage development team(s) and mitigate the risk of losing coding staffs in an ongoing project.  

   > "Avoid the danger of poor planning, lack of upfront design and  Architecture, and absence of CI/CD pipelines and coding standards. More importantly, incorporate tests in your Deployment pipeline."
   
   **iii.** Take advantage of Cloud services, and ensure coding standards and best practices.  
   **iv.**  Provision Cloud infrastructure, monitor usage and manage cost.  
   **v.**   Automate deploymemt to the Cloud with seamless integration testing.

In general terms, we will work to ensure African tech startups and corporations build properly in order to scale globally, and those will hopefully include members of this community. 
This community is meant to trascend several generations and our legacy should remain after we are long gone. It's our way of giving back to the community that breeds us.


## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Structure  

_**Board of Directors**_ will be voted in yearly(maximum of 11 members) with one person serving as President, and one person, Vice president.
We do have space on the Board for a standby Solicitor(legal expert) to help with possible legal issues and much more.

_**Project Committees**_ will maintain projects with each member having a given role.

_**Project Owners**_ are people who decide to move a project from an existing Organization or Repository to ours and so has a claim of ownership on the project.

_**Maintainers**_ are the only people with commit access to a project. Often listed in the README file as maintainers.
Regardless of their day-to-day activities, a maintainer is someone who feels responsible over the direction of a project, its outcome and is committed to improving it.

_**Contributors**_ could be anyone who comment on an issue or pull request, people who add value to the project(triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events, or anybody with a merged pull request).

_**Committers**_ are people given commit(not merge) access on a project.

_**Sponsors**_ are people who provide financial, legal, and professional non-technical contributions to the community as a whole.

_**Fiscal Sponsor**_ _CSF_ may serve as fiscal sponsor for _**Project owners**_ who doesn't want to go through the trouble of setting up a Non-profit. As a non-profit fiscal sponsor, we'll accept donations on their behalf usually in exchange for a percentage of the donation.


## 🥇 Meritocracy  

Developers are admitted onboard projects based on experience, contributions and performance and allowed to move up the ranks.

### 👨‍💼 Project Committees

- _How to become a Project Commitee_: Only open to _members_ of the community.   
These are usually people who jointly decided to move forward with a project idea by submitting a proposal for consideration by the Board.

### 🫂 Members

- _How to become a Member_:
You can become a member by visiting this [section](#become-member) to join the Whatsapp community.

### 🤝 Contributors

- _How to become a Contributor_:
You don't have to be a member of the community to contribute. for example, you can help in writing our documentations, help files, make changes on codes, report bugs or just simply comment on an issue on a project. Every contribution will be duely recognized and appreciated.  

- A _Contributor_ becomes a _Committer_ after having cloned a project, raise a PR(Pull Request), commit changes and those are accepted by the _Maintainers_ of the project.
