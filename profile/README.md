Build a team, launch, scale, and grow!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## üê¥ About us
_The Cometbid Software Foundation (CSF for short)_ is a non-profit public organization to provide a platform for open, collaborative Software development projects by supplying Cloud infrastructure, management, monitoring, communication, and Business infrastructure for Startups, Green-field projects and Corporations.

## Background and History
1. _The Cometbid Software Foundation_ is heavily linked to the cometbid-project idea on github with the author's several years of labouring in isolation on projects.
2. CSF started with a group of tech experts especially of African descent who over the years have had challenges working in Silos and wishes to see collaboration become a central ingredient for success.
   
More later ...  


### üèπ Aims and Objectives

1. To build a community of tech experts that share ideas and  build projects collectively.
2. To build groups/teams from the community that discuss tech topics of interest.
3. To serve as avenue for Businesses and External entities to solicit usage of our code components with paid support in the long-term - while they can also contribute code to the community's projects.
4. In this community, all codes will be free for both Personal and Commercial usage with conditions of use, and paid-support agreements under the OSS(Open Software Standard) standards.
5. We will work to ensure high quality of our Design, maintain high-level coding standards, adherence to local and international laws on data usage and distribution, code quality, testability, reusability, maintenance, and documentation.
6. Members and Contributors will sign an MOU(Memorandum of Understanding), and Copyright agreement on usage of their work as all contributions is voluntary(unpaid).
7. To provide legal protection to volunteers working on CSF projects, and to prevent the 'Cometbid' brand name from being used by other orgaizations with permission.
8. To provide expert advice to African startups via Tech events, shows, trainings and Conferences mostly on how to:
   i.   Structure software devleopment team to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.  
   ii.  Manage development team(s) and mitigate the risk of losing coding staffs in an ongoing project.  
        Avoid the danger of poor planning, lack of upfront design and  Architecture, and absence of CI/CD pipelines and coding standards. More importantly, to incorporate tests in the Deployment pipeline.  
   iii. Take advantage of Cloud services, and ensure coding standards and best practices.  
   iv. Provision Cloud infrastructure, monitor usage and manage cost.  
   v. Automate deploymemt to the Cloud with seamless integration testing.

In general terms, we will work to ensure African tech startups and corporations build properly in order to scale globally, and those will include members of this community.
This community is meant to trascend several generations and legacy must remain after we are long gone.



## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Community Structure  

_**Board of Directors**_ will be voted in yearly(maximum of 5 members) with one person serving as President, and one person, Vice president.
We have a Solicitor to help with possible legal issues and much more.

_**Project Committees**_ will maintain projects with each member having a given role.

_**Maintainers**_ are the only people with commit access. Often listed in the README as maintainers.
Regardless of their day-to-day activities, a maintainer is someone who feels responsible over the direction of the project, its outcome and is committed to improving it.

_**Contributors**_ could be anyone who comment on an issue or pull request, people who add value to the project(triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events, or anybody with a merged pull request.

_**Committers**_ are people given commit access on a project.

_**Sponsors**_ are people who provide financial, legal, and professional non-technical contributions to the community as a whole.


_**Fiscal Sponsor**_ _CSF_ may serve as fiscal sponsor project owners who doesn't to go through the trouble of setting up a Non-profit. As a nonprofit fiscal sponsor, we accepts donation on their behalf usually in exchange for a percentage of the donation.


## ü•á Meritocracy  

Developers are admitted onboard projects based on experience, contributions and performance and allowed to move up the ranks.
