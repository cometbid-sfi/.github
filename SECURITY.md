## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Cometbid Technology Foundation takes the security of our software products and services seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

Please include the following information:

1. Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
5. Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
6. Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
7. Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- Within 24 hours: Acknowledgment of your report
- Within 72 hours: Initial assessment and response
- Within 7 days: Expected timeline for patch
