### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
* Document new code based on our [documentation standards](#documentation-standards)
* End all files with a newline

## Development Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Coding Standards

* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow our ESLint configuration
* Write tests for new features
* Maintain existing code style
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Keep functions small and focused
* Comment complex logic

```typescript
// Good example
async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
  try {
    const user = await userRepository.findById(userId);
    if (!user) {
      throw new UserNotFoundError(userId);
    }
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to get user profile', { userId, error });
    throw error;
  }
}
```
### Documentation Standards 

* Use JSDoc for function and class documentation
* Include examples in documentation
* Keep README files up to date
* Document configuration options
* Include setup instructions

```typescript
/**
 * Processes user authentication request
 * @param {AuthRequest} request - The authentication request
 * @returns {Promise<AuthResponse>} The authentication response
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 * @example
 * const response = await authenticateUser({
 *   username: 'john.doe',
 *   password: 'secure123'
 * });
 */
```
### Setting Up Your Development Environment

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/organization/project.git
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Commit Messages
We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation only changes
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
  
Example:
```

- Add JWT token generation
- Implement token validation
- Add refresh token functionality

Closes #123

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new features
* Maintain existing test coverage
* Run the full test suite before submitting PRs
* Include integration tests where appropriate

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create new user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      name: 'Test User'
    };
    const user = await userService.createUser(userData);
    expect(user).toHaveProperty('id');
    expect(user.email).toBe(userData.email);
  });
});
